          Line: He never liked us, you know.
        - Char: Millie
          Line: No, he never did. I've always thought that if he has just settled down...
        - Char: Gertie 
          Line: You know, here in town near family...
        - Char: Millie
          Line: That he would have turned out all right.

        - Char: Gertie
          Line: Perhaps we should check on the treasure.
        - Char: Millie
          Line: We really must get Charlie to bury it. It's such a nuisance having it lying around.

        - Char: Millie
          Line: What is it dear?
